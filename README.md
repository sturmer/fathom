# Fathom

A better way to plan your reads.

*Fathom* lets you sort the books you want to read next along _themes_. Each theme is a list of books, in the order you plan to read them. Example themes:

- all Strega/Nobel/Man Booker prize winners
- Existentialism
- Black History
- color: Red
- Crime novels in 17th century Greece

and so on. You can have as many themes as you want.

*Fathom* can recommend books in a given theme. It lets you pick books from your 
Storygraph/Goodreads/LibraryThing account. It mails you summaries of your reads periodically.
